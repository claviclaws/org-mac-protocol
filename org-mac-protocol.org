  : Version: 0.628

  A suite of scripts that allow the user to annotate their org-mode
  buffers without switching focus from other OS X applications
  to Emacs.

  The AppleScripts interface with org-protocol.el to extract content
  from, and link to, documents and applications. 

  Three modes of interaction are provided:

  =org-link= creates an org-mode link and adds it to =*Org Links*= and
  the kill-ring.

  =org-remember= pops up a small =*Remember*= frame with links and,
  where possible, extracted content embedded.

  =org-note= pops up a small =*Remember*= frame for note taking
  independent of the document being worked on.

** Included files
   
   - org-mac-protocol.pkg (installer package)
   - sources (including Scripting Additions sources)
   - org-mac-protocol.org (this manual)

** Requirements

   - OS X 10.5 (untested on previous versions)

   - [[http://orgmode.org][Org-Mode]] 6.28 or above
   - [[https://gna.org/p/remember-el][Remember]]

** Obtaining
   An archive can be downloaded [[http://claviclaws.net/org/omp0628.dmg][here]].

** Installation and configuration
*** Install files
**** org-mac-protocol.pkg

    - Launch the installer and follow on screen instructions.  You
      must set a location for org-mac-protocol.el that is on your
      Emacs load-path.

**** Manual installation

    - Copy files from the sources directory to their relevant
      locations.
      
      =org-mac-protocol.el= should be placed on your Emacs load-path.

      The contents of the =Scripts= directory should be placed in
      =~/Library/Scripts/=.

      =URI Escape.osax= should be placed in
      =~/Library/ScriptingAdditions/=, creating the directory if necessary.

*** Edit your .emacs
**** Require org-mac-protocol.el

     : (require 'org-mac-protocol)

**** Run emacsserver

     : (server-start)

**** /Optional:/ Edit the default =*Remember*= templates

     Two default =*Remember*= templates are provided by
     org-mac-protocol.el.
     
     - These can be edited to your tastes

       The defaults are:

       : ("AppleScript remember" ?y "* %?\n\n  Source: %u, %c\n\n  %i" (concat org-directory "inbox.org") "Remember")
       
       : ("AppleScript note" ?z "* %?\n\n  Source: %u\n" (concat org-directory "inbox.org") "Notes")
       
       This template can be fairly flexible. The only essential items
       are =?y= and =?z= (the template selection characters), and, for
       =org-remember=, =%c= (the link to the document), and =%i= (the
       selection within the document).

       If you choose to alter the template selection characters, you
       *must* alter =theProtocol= variable in =org-remember.scpt= and
       =org-note.scpt= to reflect your changes.

       Please see the [[http://orgmode.org/manual/Remember-templates.html#Remember-templates][org manual]] and the [[http://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/org-protocol.php][org-protocol.el manual]] for
       further details on template customisation.

*** Edit orgQSLib/getEmacsClient.scpt
    
    - Set =theEmacsClient= to point to emacsclient for your flavour of Emacs.
      
      The default setting should work with Carbon Emacs and CVS Emacs.
      Aquamacs users will have to edit this variable.

** Usage
   There are three scripts that can be invoked; =org-link=,
   =org-note=, and =org-remember=. These scripts can be called by
   various methods, for example, the [[file://Applications/AppleScript/AppleScript%20Utility.app/][Script menu]] in the menu bar,
   [[http://code.google.com/p/blacktree-alchemy/][Quicksilver]], [[http://www.red-sweater.com/fastscripts/][FastScripts]] etc.

*** Currently supported applications

    |          | org-link           | org-note | org-remember                     |
    |----------+--------------------+----------+----------------------------------|
    | Finder   | Link: file         | Yes      | Content: no                      |
    | Safari   | Link: URL          | Yes      | Content: current selection       |
    | Mail     | Link: message      | Yes      | Content: entire message          |
    | Skim     | Link: PDF          | Yes      | Content: current selection       |
    | BibDesk  | Link: entry        | Yes      | Content: Harvard style citation  |
    | Terminal | Link: Terminal.app | Yes      | Content: current window contents |


    - Unsupported applications that are AppleScript aware will attempt
      to create links to the front document, but do not support
      selected content.      

    - Preview.app is /not/ AppleScript aware and Firefox has such
      limited AppleScript support as to be useless.
      
*** org-link
    Creates an org-mode link from the front document and passes it to
    emacsclient, adding it to =*Org Links*= and the kill-ring.

    - Run =org-link=

*** org-note
    Creates a note in an org-mode buffer. Does not link to the front
    document.

    - Run =org-note=
    - Enter note in pop-up =*Remember*= buffer
    - File note to return to previous application
      
*** org-remember
    Creates a note in an org-mode buffer. Links to the file of the
    front document, and uses selection in front document as
    initial content of the =*Remember*= buffer.

    - Run =org-remember=
    - Enter note in pop-up =*Remember*= buffer
    - File note to return to previous application
       
** TODO
   Support for further applications will also require defining [[http://orgmode.org/manual/Adding-hyperlink-types.html#Adding-hyperlink-types][new
   org-mode hyperlinks]], as will improvements to linking for PDF files
   and Terminal. Planned support includes:

   - [ ] Skim (improved)
   - [ ] Terminal (improved)
   - [ ] iCal
   - [ ] Microsoft Office
   - [ ] iTunes
   - [ ] iPhoto
   - [ ] Firefox (if AppleScript support is improved)
